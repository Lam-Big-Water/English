Visitor: Hi, do you know how to get to Hong Kong Park?

Me: Yes, enter this building, take the escalator to the G/F, then exit and go into the MTR station on the right. Leave through Exit C. Then, take the escalator on the left into the mall. Hong Kong Park is right outside the exit on the second floor – you’ll see the signs.

Him: Hello, I'm a Foodpanda delivery driver. Do you have enough change?

Me: How much is it in total?

Him: It's 82.5 Hong Kong dollars. If you don’t have enough change, I’ll need to go to a convenience store to break some change first.

Me: Oh, I probably don’t have enough change, so thank you for your help!

Me：Excuse me, could you please close the elevator door?

Him：Oh, sorry about that!

Him：Hi, do you know where I’m supposed to submit this document? I just finished paying for it at the Accounting Department on the Lower Ground 2.

Me：I’m not really sure—you’ll need to ask at the information desk on the ground floor.

Him：Okay, thank you!

Me：This is Lower Ground 4. You’ll need to stay on this elevator to go back up to the ground floor.

Him：Alright, thanks!
