- house

Here are the corrected sentences based on your original intent:

---

1. **My grandfather built this house 40 years ago.**  
   (Use the simple past tense "built" instead of "was build," and remove "for" before "40 years ago.")

2. **I decided to share the house with my brother.**  
   (Use the past tense "decided" and replace "for" with "with.")

3. **They demolished the old house today.**  
   (Use the past tense "demolished" instead of "demolish.")

4. **We renovated the house we rented.**  
   (Use the past tense "renovated" and clarify "the house we rented" instead of "a rent house.")

5. **I broke into the house because I lost my keys.**  
   (Use the past tense "broke" and replace "when" with "because" for clarity.)

6. **We moved out on Sunday.**  
   (Use the past tense "moved" and replace "the house" with "out" for accuracy. Use "on" instead of "at" for days of the week.)

7. **My parents live in a big house.**  
   (This sentence is correct as is.)

8. **My brother often stays at his friend's house.**  
   (Replace "always" with "often" for better nuance and add the possessive apostrophe to "friend's.")

9. **When I passed Sam's house, they were eating in the living room.**  
   (Use the past tense "passed" and the past continuous tense "were eating.")

10. **I locked myself out of the house at midnight.**  
    (Use the past tense "locked" and correct "the minight" to "midnight.")

Here’s an explanation of what went wrong in each sentence and the corrected versions:

1. Please, use this stairs run up to the canteen of the second floor.
Issue:
"This stairs" is incorrect because "stairs" is plural and requires "these" instead of "this."
"Run up" is unnecessary and awkward in this context.
Corrected:
"Please use these stairs to go up to the canteen on the second floor."
2. I have to climb this stairs going to work for everyday.
Issue:
"This stairs" should be "these stairs."
"For everyday" is incorrect; "every day" should be written as two words.
Corrected:
"I have to climb these stairs every day on my way to work."
3. Suddenly, some one run up the stairs.
Issue:
"Some one" should be written as one word: "someone."
"Run" should be "ran" to match the past tense.
Corrected:
"Suddenly, someone ran up the stairs."
4. I fall down the stairs at yesterday.
Issue:
"Fall" should be in the past tense: "fell."
"At yesterday" is incorrect; "yesterday" should stand alone.
Corrected:
"I fell down the stairs yesterday."
5. I spend 40 minutes to carry the washing machine down the stairs bottom.
Issue:
"Spend" should be in the past tense: "spent."
"To carry" is correct but can be more concise.
"Down the stairs bottom" is redundant; "down the stairs" suffices.
Corrected:
"I spent 40 minutes carrying the washing machine down the stairs."
6. I office is the top of the stairs.
Issue:
"I office" is incorrect; it should be "My office."
"The top of the stairs" is correct but could be more precise.
Corrected:
"My office is at the top of the stairs."
